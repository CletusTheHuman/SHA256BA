This application includes a basic login and logout system with User and Admin role access. Once logged in, users can access multiple cryptographic tools from the menu.

The program implements SHA-256 hashing, allowing users to input any string and generate a secure hash value. This demonstrates one-way hashing commonly used for data integrity and password storage.

The application also includes a Caesar cipher encryption system. Messages can be encrypted by shifting each letter forward by three positions in the alphabet and decrypted by reversing the shift. This demonstrates a simple substitution cipher.

These features show authentication control, encryption/decryption, and cryptographic hashing.
